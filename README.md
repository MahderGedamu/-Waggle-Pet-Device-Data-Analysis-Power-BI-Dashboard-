# Waggle: LAPDOG VS. LAPCAT
## Overview
This is Udacity’s second project under the Nanodegree Program Data Analysis and Visualization with Microsoft Power BI and focuses on creating visualization using Power BI. (Completed on January 2025)

## 📌 Project Overview

This Power BI project was built for **Waggle**, a pet tech startup that produces **Lapdog** and **Lapcat** fitness tracker devices. The objective was to analyze and compare pet activity, device reviews, family demographics, and regional trends. This interactive dashboard enables Waggle’s leadership team to make informed marketing and product decisions based on real-world data from their customer base.

## Business Requests
The CEO is curious about the following questions:

Did the average daily steps increase for cats wearing the device as they did for dogs?

Were owners of Lapcat devices as satisfied with the product as Lapdog owners?

The Chief Marketing Officer would like the report to be “on-brand” by including only colors from the Waggle color palette, the Waggle logo, and other approved company logos and icons.

The product team would like to incorporate other visuals and insights as we see fit but is most interested in demographic comparisons between the dogs and cats using Waggle devices as well as any information about the families who own the pets. They would also like slicers to help them filter and explore on their own.
